Sharpex2D
===================

<h3>What is Sharpex2D?</h3>

Sharpex2D or short SGL is a 2D component based GameEngine for .NET developers.
It offers various build-in components such as physic, sound, rendering, content managing, networkservices and much more.


<h3>Compatibility</h3>

Windows based systems with .NET Framework 4.0 or higher.



<h3>Concepts</h3>

SGL is based on an abstract infrastructure, which means components such as renderer or sound could be swaped to third-party
or your own components.

All required game objects find place in the central ComponentManager including GameLoop, Serializers, Soundsystems.

The GameLoop is highly configurable and almost all classes (specific classes which uses the IGameHandler interface) are
able to subscribe to the GameLoop.

Sharpex.GameLibrary comes "out of the box" which means it runs fully without third-party.
